## About

This is the source code for the site currently hosted at https://www.tomspencer.dev.

The code allows a static website to be generated using the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) static site generator.

## Development

- `hugo new blog/YYYY-MM-DD-<kebab-case-post-name>.md`: create a new blog post. Name of post will be generated from the kebab-case name.
- `hugo server`: run a development server. Site will be available at http://localhost:1313.
- `hugo server -D`: as above but also previews draft posts.

## Deployment

The blog is hosted on Netlify. Push a commit to the master branch and the site will be automatically built and deployed.

## 🚀 Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
├── public/
├── src/
│   ├── components/
│   ├── content/
│   ├── layouts/
│   └── pages/
├── astro.config.mjs
├── README.md
├── package.json
└── tsconfig.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

The `src/content/` directory contains "collections" of related Markdown and MDX documents. Use `getCollection()` to retrieve posts from `src/content/blog/`, and type-check your frontmatter using an optional schema. See [Astro's Content Collections docs](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/content-collections/) to learn more.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## 🧞 Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |
