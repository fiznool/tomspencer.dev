Hi, I'm Tom - a JavaScript consultant based in Bristol, UK.

For the last 12 years I’ve been architecting and developing single-page web applications and mobile apps, primarily using JavaScript. I’ve worked for an early stage startup and an [award-winning mobile agency](http://mubaloo.com/), and for the past 4 years I've been running my own consultancy [Studio Zeffa](http://studiozeffa.com), where I provide app development and training services to a variety of different clients.

Read on to find out more about the services I offer, my portfolio and previous experience. You can also check out my [GitHub profile](https://github.com) and visit my [LinkedIn page](https://uk.linkedin.com/in/fiznool).

If you are interesting in hiring me to work on a web or mobile application, or would like to learn more about the training courses I run, why not [get in touch](mailto:tom.spencer@studiozeffa.com)?

Testimonials
------------

Here are a sample of kind words from past and current clients: more testimonials can be found on my [LinkedIn page](https://www.linkedin.com/in/fiznool/).

> It was a true pleasure working with Tom. Right from the first point of contact Tom quickly understood and applied himself to the needs of correlating my designs to the finished app. His attention to detail was exceptional, it was incredibly refreshing to work with someone who really cared and realised the importance of detail.

> _Ed George, Brand and Business Strategy Specialist at [Postsaver Ltd](https://www.postsaver.com)_

---

> Tom is excellent! He teaches our students how to build mobile apps on our coding bootcamp, and has delivered high level, bespoke, technical workshops for our clients. He is extremely personable, professional, reliable and knowledgable and never fails to deliver outstanding work.

> _Pete New, founder at [DevelopMe Training](https://developme.training/)_

---

> Tom is a fantastic full-stack JS developer. He is equally skilled in front-end and server-side work, and will work quickly and thoughtfully, whatever the task. Tom will offer constructive feedback on designs/plans where he has ideas or suggestions. Rather than simply implement blindly, he will think of the objectives and practicalities, and work to develop a solution. I don't often come across developers like this.

> _John Jackson, founder at [Flow XO](https://flowxo.com)_

---------

> Tom has worked with Natural Apptitude on a number of projects ranging from mobile app development to work on our backend services. During these contracts Tom has demonstrated a very high level of professionalism and impressed not only with excellent and broad technical skills, but also his soft-skills: fitting in quickly and working well with both colleagues and clients. Overall, Tom has been an excellent member of our team and we would not hesitate in recommending him to others.

> _Joe Woodhouse, founder at [Natural Apptitude](http://www.natural-apptitude.co.uk/)_

Portfolio

### [Postsaver](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/postsaver/id1420447151?mt=8)

A smartphone app to provide video instructions on how to install a [Postsaver](https://www.postsaver.com) sleeve. Created for [iPhone](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/postsaver/id1420447151?mt=8) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.postsaver.postsaverapp).

* I was contracted to build the apps from a set of supplied design files.
* The app allows users to view 'how-to' video instructions on installing the Postsaver product, a protective sleeve for fence posts.
* The app also includes an FAQ section and other illustrated guides, along with a link to call or email for support, to ensure that the user has everything they need to install the product.
* All content is cached for offline use, a key business requirement as many users will be installing fence posts without an Internet connection on their device.
* A sister app [Polesaver](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/polesaver/id1420447165) was also created using a similar look and feel, with different content.
* The apps were built using the React Native framework and deployed with the help of [fastlane](https://fastlane.tools).

*   App was built using the Ionic Framework, with custom designs implemented from supplied Photoshop comps.

*   Integrated with [Recurly](https://recurly.com) to handle recurring subscription payments.

Training Sessions
-----------------

### [DevelopMe Fellowship](https://developme.training/fellowship/), 2016-present

I've been an instructor on the DevelopMe_ fellowship bootcamp since its inception in 2016. The fellowship is a 12-week intensive course aiming to teach students the basics of web development, through a series of instructor-led sessions and workshops.

Instructors are given a topic to teach, but otherwise are free to set their own curriculum. Currently, I teach the fundamentals of React Native over the course of a week, and all of my resources [are freely available on GitHub](https://github.com/studiozeffa/react-native-training-course).

### AngularJS / TypeScript training, [Wazoku](https://www.wazoku.com)

Partnering with DevelopMe_, two separate workshops were prepared and delivered to developers from [Wazoku](https://www.wazoku.com). In this workshop, we covered advanced concepts of AngularJS and TypeScript in a collaborative environment, working through challenges as a group.

Feedback from Wazoku was very positive, proven by the desire to follow on from the AngularJS workshop with a TypeScript one.
