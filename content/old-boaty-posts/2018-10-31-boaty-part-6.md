description: "We're continuing the implementation of a React Native app by adding a launch screen to the app, also known as a splash screen."

> Note: this is part 6 of a series of posts, aimed at building a React Native app from the ground up. If you haven't already done so, it's worth starting from [the beginning of the series]({{< relref "2018-10-14-boaty-part-1.md" >}}).

In [part 5]({{< relref "2018-10-26-boaty-part-5.md" >}}), we added an app icon to our app. We're going to continue the 'productisation' of the app by adding a launch screen, which is displayed when the app is first launched.

**

Done:

- splashscreen background image, resized (check boaty repo)

TODO:

- splashscreen icon (foreground)
- method to add splashscreen ios, android

**

We've added launch screens for the iOS and Android variants of our app, which are shown in full screen when the app is first loaded.

The code for this section can be found [on the accompanying GitHub repo](https://github.com/studiozeffa/boaty-app/tree/part-06), make sure to check out the [changes to the files from part 5](https://github.com/studiozeffa/boaty-app/compare/part-05...part-06).
