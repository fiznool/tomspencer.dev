Well, I've [been away for a little while](http://200daysaway.tumblr.com). 200 days' worh of travelling has changed many aspects of me and my life, but I'm actually happy to be back and looking forward to getting back into the world of web development.

I'm sure things have progressed at a fast rate over the past 7 months, and so I'm expecting a bit of research and training to hone my skills once again. Exciting times!

Having blogged while we were away, I have a new enthusiam for writing regularly, and so I have redesigned this blog and started afresh. I hope to keep updating it on a regular basis. Watch this space!
