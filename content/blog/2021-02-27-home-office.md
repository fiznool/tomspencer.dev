The COVID-19 pandemic transformed the workplace for many people during 2020, closing offices and forcing millions to work from home. The figures don't lie: in April 2020, [almost half of the workforce in the UK worked from home](https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/employmentandemployeetypes/bulletins/coronavirusandhomeworkingintheuk/april2020). To some, this was a blessing: no commute, better flexibility and fewer interruptions meant that productivity and happiness increased, despite the worries associated with the pandemic. Others were not so keen: citing a lack of work-life separation, isolation and more interruptions, especially since home working spaces are often shared with other members of the household. I particularly feel for those who have young children - with schools closed, the challenge of carrying out work duties alongside childcare is a very stressful experience.

Personally, I have been enjoying the benefits of home working since 2014, although I am fortunate to have a separate room in which to call my 'office', and so it is easier to maintain a healthy work/life balance, and I can shut the door to drown out the noise from the rest of the household. In this article I'd like to share my home office setup.

Without further ado:

## Hardware

### Laptop

My main machine is a 2018 Macbook Pro (aka _the one with the touch bar_), 2.9 GHz 6-Core Intel Core i9, 32GB RAM, 1TB SSD. Purchased second hand on eBay in October 2019 for £2,399.00, which included 2 years Apple Care.

This is the second time I've bought a Mac from eBay. Each time I've made sure to buy one with Apple Care, which has been essential - in both cases I have made a claim (for this device, the screen had a group of dead pixels - the screen replacement would have cost £600 otherwise).

Thankfully, the laptop is docked 99% of the time, which means I don't have to use the awful keyboard. I still stare occasionally at the touch bar, marvelling in its uselessness.

I have serious M1 envy, but two things are holding me back:

- The M1 Macbook Pro [only supports a single external display](https://support.apple.com/kb/SP824). My setup has always included two external monitors, and going back to one would seriously hamper my productivity. I have considered a Mac Mini but the portability of the MBP (even in lockdown times) is not something I'm prepared to sacrifice.
- [Docker is not fully supported on the M1 chip (yet)](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/apple-m1/). I use Docker on a daily basis and although at the time of writing there is a tech preview available, it doesn't seem worth the upgrade until it is ready for prime time.

### Displays

A [dual desk mount arm](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B01N4L6MLM) holds two [Samsung U24E850 4k monitors](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B00WUACVIC). They are 24" in size, which is unusual for 4k displays: most are at least 28". I specifically wanted two smaller screens to preserve 'retina' sharpness: these displays offer a screen density of 183ppi (pixels per inch), which is not too far away from the MBP's built-in screen (which has 220ppi). Since I look at code all day, crispness of text is of paramount importance to me.

For reference, here is the ppi for some other common 4k screen sizes:

- 28": 157ppi
- 32": 137ppi

Also worth noting is a 5k 32" screen has the same ppi as a 4k 24" one. Sadly, they don't seem to exist!

### Dock

2016 saw a big Macbook Pro design refresh. Although the touch bar took much of the headlines, another big change was the introduction of USB-C ports for all external connectivity. For many, this means [dongle life / hell](https://mashable.com/2016/10/28/macbook-pro-dongle-hell) but a nicer outcome is the option to connect the laptop to displays, input devices and power via one cable.

Since I was looking to connect two external displays via DisplayPort (to achieve 60Hz refresh rate across the board), options were limited. After a false start with a [Caldigit dock](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B07VJMKYDF) (which didn't seem to recognise displays when the laptop woke from sleep), I settled on a [Startech Thunderbolt 3 dock](https://www.startech.com/en-gb/cards-adapters/tb3dk2dhvue) which has been pretty much flawless. It's really nice to be able to dock and undock the laptop so easily, something that was a bit of a pain with the older MBP design.

You will notice from the picture above that I like to use the laptop display as a third screen, this ruled out the (otherwise excellent) [Henge Dock](https://www.brydge.com/products/macbook-vertical-dock).

### Headphones

The essential companion to a coder's day. Even though I work from home, years of office work have conditioned me to wearing headphones while I work - nowadays they are useful at drowning out the household noise, rather than open-plan office chatter.

After faffing around with cheaper headphones, I invested in the [Bose QuietComfort 35ii](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0756CYWWD) cans. The old adage, _you get what you pay for_ really applies here. The only complaint is I find them a little uncomfortable to use all day, compared to the [Jabra Move](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B00NHSFWG4) headphones I used previously. The sound quality more than makes up for it, though!

### Other peripherals

- A [Logitech C920 USB camera](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B006A2Q81M), which is much better than the built-in camera on the MacBook Pro. Surely Apple must address this in a future update, especially with the rise of video calling?
- A Magic Mouse 2 and USB wired Apple keyboard. I couldn't justify the cost of a Magic keyboard, when I have a couple of the older USB ones lying around at home.
