The COVID-19 pandemic transformed the workplace for many people during 2020, closing offices and forcing millions to work from home. The figures don't lie: in April 2020, [almost half of the workforce in the UK worked from home](https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/employmentandemployeetypes/bulletins/coronavirusandhomeworkingintheuk/april2020). To some, this was a blessing: no commute, better flexibility and fewer interruptions meant that productivity and happiness increased, despite the worries associated with the pandemic. Others were not so keen: citing a lack of work-life separation, isolation and more interruptions, especially since home working spaces are often shared with other members of the household. I particularly feel for those who have young children - with schools closed, the challenge of carrying out work duties alongside childcare is a very stressful experience.

Personally, I have been enjoying the benefits of home working since 2014, although I am fortunate to have a separate room in which to call my 'office', and so it is easier to maintain a healthy work/life balance, and I can shut the door to drown out the noise from the rest of the household. In this article I'd like to share my home office setup.

Without further ado:

## Hardware

### Laptop

My main machine is a 2018 Macbook Pro (aka _the one with the touch bar_), 2.9 GHz 6-Core Intel Core i9, 32GB RAM, 1TB SSD. Purchased second hand on eBay in October 2019 for £2,399.00, which included 2 years Apple Care.

This is the second time I've bought a Mac from eBay. Each time I've made sure to buy one with Apple Care, which has been essential - in both cases I have made a claim (for this device, the screen had a group of dead pixels - the screen replacement would have cost £600 otherwise).

Thankfully, the laptop is docked 99% of the time, which means I don't have to use the awful keyboard. I still stare occasionally at the touch bar, marvelling in its uselessness.

I have serious M1 envy, but two things are holding me back:

- The M1 Macbook Pro [only supports a single external display](https://support.apple.com/kb/SP824). My setup has always included two external monitors, and going back to one would seriously hamper my productivity. I have considered a Mac Mini but the portability of the MBP (even in lockdown times) is not something I'm prepared to sacrifice.
- [Docker is not fully supported on the M1 chip (yet)](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/apple-m1/). I use Docker on a daily basis and although at the time of writing there is a tech preview available, it doesn't seem worth the upgrade until it is ready for prime time.

### Displays

A [dual desk mount arm](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B01N4L6MLM) holds two [Samsung U24E850 4k monitors](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B00WUACVIC). They are 24" in size, which is unusual for 4k displays: most are at least 28". I specifically wanted two smaller screens to preserve 'retina' sharpness: these displays offer 183ppi (pixels per inch), which is not too far away from the MBP's built-in screen (which has 220ppi). Since I look at code all day, crispness of text is of paramount importance to me.
