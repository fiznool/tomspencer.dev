While I was away, I had a lot of time to think about the future. The past 8 years building web apps have been a lot of fun - challenging, sure, but fun too. Rather quickly, I came to the conclusion that I wanted to return to doing the job I love.

Prior to going away, to add a bit of money to our travelling fund, I took on some contract work in addition to my full-time job at [Mubaloo](http://mubaloo.com). It was hard work, coming home after a 9-5 to continue working for a few more hours every evening, not to mention the weekends, but I really enjoyed working on the project. It helped I had an excellent client, who had a sound technical understanding of the project and paid invoices very promptly! I managed to finish the project just before leaving, and I am still quite proud of [the way it turned out](http://torpio.com/app).

The entire experience stayed with me during our time away, and I realised that being self-employed could be a great way to make a living. So, as I am now returning to the world of work, I'm going to give it a shot. As of today, I am setup as a sole trader, and I am ready to take on new web projects, on a contract basis.

If you are looking to develop a web application, why not [get in touch](mailto:fiznool@gmail.com) and see if I can help you out?
