At Mubaloo I was primarily responsible for developing cross-platform mobile apps using HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Backbone.js and PhoneGap. Working in a fast-paced agency environment, I enjoyed a hands-on role throughout the software delivery lifecycle, frequently attending client meetings, scoping/quoting, writing user stories, wireframing, carrying out UX design, development, testing and deploying to app stores.
