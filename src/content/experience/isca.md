Isca Networks was a startup building web-based touch screen kiosk hardware and software. I co-founded the company and led the team as CEO.

- Product was launched in 2009; I led the team to deployment of over 200 kiosks across 9 retail stores in France.
- My duties varied from product development, handling hardware operations and logistics, liaising with customers and investors, supporting product, setting targets, reporting results to Board of Directors and handling financial forecasts.
- Business was eventually relocated to Canada. I decided to remain in the UK and resigned from the company.
