An app to report the 'usefulness' of river barriers across Europe.

On discovery of a water barrier, the user takes a photo of it, and answers a series of questions, including the type of barrier (e.g. dam, weir), height, 'usefulness' and location. This data is then sent to AMBER, and used to better understand how water barriers are performing.

The app was built as a native binary using the Ionic Framework and distributed to iOS and Android devices via the respective app stores.
