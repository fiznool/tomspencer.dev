Candide was a social networking app for gardeners. It offered a Facebook-style news feed, where users could interact via text, image and video posts, and offered a way to discover gardening topics and public gardens nearby. It was built using React Native.

I was involved in building the initial version of the 'Discovery' section in the app, which included a curated list of gardening topics and nearby locations that users could discover. The work involved fetching data from a remote endpoint and displaying it in a masonry-style grid layout.

The app was ultimately launched and used for several years, by hundreds of thousands of users. It was eventually retired in December 2023.
