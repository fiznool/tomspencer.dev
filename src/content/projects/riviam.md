The RIVIAM platform is used to track immunisations. It comprises of a consent platform, to gather consent for administering immunisations, and a system to track and analyse the resulting immunisations.

The mobile app is used by clinicians who are administering immunisations and vaccinations in the field. It allows a clinician to report the outcome of the immunisation, which can then be monitored and reported by office staff. It is built using React Native, and is predominantly available for the iPad platform.

To date I have supplied the following services:

- Consulting on the architecture of the message queue system that syncs immunisation records with the backend
- Improving performance of cryptographic features by moving implementation to native code
- Upgrading dependencies to the latest versions
