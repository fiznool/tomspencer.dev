An online marketplace to improve the process by which restaurants, hotels, delicatessens and other businesses purchase food from vendors.

I was tasked to assist with the front-end implementation of a number of sections of the website, including a 'purchase configuration' component, which allowed purchasers to configure the amount of food being ordered. This was built using Stimulus.js, and was part of a Ruby on Rails codebase.

The project is now live and bringing significant improvements to the overall food purchasing process, largely in the US.
