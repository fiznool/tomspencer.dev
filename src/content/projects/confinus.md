[Confinus](https://www.confinus.com/) is a web-based marketplace for vendors, distributors and buyers in the food industry.

The product aims to modernise existing order workflows, which are primarily conducted over the telephone.

I was brought in to re-architect the front-end of the site, which was initially built using a custom framework. Since the backend is built with Rails, Stimulus.js was a natural choice, and I worked through the rebuild using TypeScript and SASS alongside the Stimulus core classes.

The project is now live and bringing significant improvements to the overall food purchasing process, largely in the US. A consumer-facing site [Haute Grub](https://www.haute-grub.com/) was also launched using the same codebase.
