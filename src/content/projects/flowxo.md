I built Flow XO from the ground up. It initially started as a tool to connect online services together in 'workflows', similar to IFTTT and Zapier, but quickly pivoted into a system for building chatbots with no coding knowledge required.

The system was built using node.js and Angular, and was deployed to Heroku. The site was eventually sold and continues to operate under the same brand, using largely the same codebase.
