Flow XO began life as the successor to Torpio, as a no-code SaaS tool to connect online services together in 'workflows', similar to IFTTT and Zapier. An MVP was launched, and it quickly became apparent that users wanted to interact with these tools via a chat interface. As a result, the platform pivoted into a system for building chatbots and kicking off workflows with no coding knowledge required.

I was the lead developer for the product, architecting and building it from the ground up. It was built using node.js and AngularJS, and deployed to Heroku via a Continuous Delivery pipeline. A robust, comprehensive set of unit and integration tests were maintained to ensure that the system underwent minimal downtime.

The site was eventually sold and continues to successfully operate under the same brand.
