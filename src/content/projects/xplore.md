The xplore suite comprised of three mobile apps and a backend system.

The main `xplore` app was built to connect local businesses with customers, through a news feed, discovery, search and payments.

`xplore POS` is an app to accept in-person payments using the xplore payment card, which automatically generated loyalty points and cashback whenever it was used.

`xplore concierge` is an app for businesses to view sales trends and communicate with customers via chat.
