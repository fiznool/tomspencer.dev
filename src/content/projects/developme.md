DevelopMe was a 12-week intensive training course, intended to provide an introduction to software development. Students undertook a curriculum comprising HTML, CSS, JavaScript and PHP, and at the end of the 12-week period were invited to interview with local companies for a further 3 month internship.

As part of the course, I delivered week-long workshops teaching students to build mobile apps, initially using the Ionic Framework (using AngularJS) and later with React Native. The workshops were held in-person at the DevelopMe facility in Bristol, UK.

Many of the students that graduated from the course continue to pursue their careers in software development in the local area. It's nice to bump into them every now and again, at local meetups or elsewhere!
