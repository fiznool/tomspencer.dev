The Polesaver app provides support on the installation, handling and maintenance of the 'Polesaver' product with a selection of guides, videos and written instructions. It was built using React Native.

One particular challenge with this app making the content available when offline, particularly the media files. Videos and images were optimised for each platform and bundled with the app, to accommodate users in locations with no mobile signal.

The app continues to be used in areas where telegraph poles are installed. The videos in particular are very useful for training new installers, saving on the cost of in-person training and reducing the level of sleeve wastage in the field.
