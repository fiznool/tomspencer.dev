Blooms for Bees is an app to identify and track bee population in the UK. When a bee is spotted, users can upload a photo, location and suggested bee species (if known). Researchers read each submission and correct any mis-identified species, notifying users in the process. The app also includes a comprehensive identification guide, detailing characteristics of the bee, commonly found locations and photos.

The app was built as a native binary using the Ionic Framework and distributed to iOS and Android devices via the respective app stores.
