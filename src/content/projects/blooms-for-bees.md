Blooms for Bees is an app to identify and track bee population in the UK.

App users complete a 5 minute survey, taking pictures of bumblebees and categorising them with help from a bee guide. The survey is then uploaded to a central system, where researchers confirm the categorisation of the bees, correcting any mis-identified species

The app also includes a comprehensive identification guide, detailing characteristics of the bee, commonly found locations and photos.

The app was built as a native binary using the Ionic Framework and distributed to iOS and Android devices via the respective app stores.

The BBC ran [a story on the app](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B7Ph-ulzuoOrdTV4RllXOE5SX2c/view) which aired on the local evening news.
