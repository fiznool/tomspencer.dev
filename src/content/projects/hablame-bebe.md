Háblame Bebé is an app that helps promote a child's bilingualism, brain development, and cultural pride. The app supplies the following functionality:

- Adding newly spoken words in both English and Spanish
- Tracking development milestones at various ages, e.g. sitting unaided, taking first steps, etc
- Viewing instructions and videos on starting conversations with your baby

A 'badge' system was used to incentivise the adding of new words and tracking milestones.

The app was built for Florida International University during my time at Calvium, using React Native. It was built according to a specification, using set of wireframes and UI comps, and is available on the iOS and Android platforms.
