Chalkboard is an app for local businesses to communicate more effectively with their customers.

I was the lead developer for the backend, architecting and building it from the ground up.

- The codebase was authored using TypeScript, running on node.js
- The mobile apps communicated with the backend via GraphQL and used OpenID Connect for authentication
- Postgres was used as the main database and queue
- The entire backend stack was deployed as a monolith to Heroku

Continuous Deployment and Test-Driven Development was employed to ensure that the latest code was present in production, with confidence that changes would not break the system. As a result, the backend encountered very little downtime throughout the 3.5 years I was involved with the project.

The mobile apps were built by other members of the team, and distributed via the relevant app stores.
