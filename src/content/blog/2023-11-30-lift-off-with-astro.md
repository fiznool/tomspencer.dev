Every few years, I make it a point to assess the technology stack powering this blog. I started with [Octopress back in 2014](/blog/2014/03/18/a-new-beginning/), then transitioned to [Hugo in 2017](/blog/2018/03/23/migrating-to-hugo/). Although Hugo has served the site well, there has always been a gap between my expertise (primarily in JavaScript) and the underlying technology of Hugo (Go). Consequently, I was cautious about making substantial changes to the site, sticking mostly to basic styling adjustments.

Recently, I came across positive reviews about [Astro](https://astro.build/). Built with node.js, its technologies resonated with me: JSX, components, scoped stylesâ€”these are all tools I'm very familiar with. Encouraged by this, I took the plunge and migrated the site from Hugo to Astro.

The migration went remarkably smoothly, with just a couple of hiccups, which I'll discuss in a separate post. Now, the site is up and running on Astro, and I feel confident about keeping it up to date. Who knows, I might even find the time to blog more regularly!
