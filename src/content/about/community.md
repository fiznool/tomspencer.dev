## Community

### [SWmobile](http://meetup.com/swmobile)

I co-founded SWmobile, a mobile-focused tech group based in the South West of England. The group has over 1,000 members and meets every month to discuss mobile design and development. The format varies, but usually involves a set of speakers presenting a chosen topic, culminating in a trip to the pub to continue the discussion.

I've spoken at a few meetups, [most recently on React Native](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBNSh6FZRFE).

### [BristolJS](http://meetup.com/bristoljs)

A 2,000+ strong meetup group that meets every month to discuss all things JavaScript.

I [delivered a lightning talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROUvsRJipUs) at a meetup in 2015 on Express.js and Passport.js.
