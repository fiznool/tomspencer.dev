Hi, I'm Tom - a web and mobile app developer based in Bristol, UK.

I’ve been designing, architecting and building web and mobile applications since 2006, primarily using JavaScript. I’ve worked for an early stage startup and an [award-winning mobile agency](http://mubaloo.com/), and for the past 10 years I've been running my own consultancy [Studio Zeffa](http://studiozeffa.com), where I provide app development and training services to a variety of different clients.

Read on to find out more about the services I offer, my portfolio and previous experience. You can also check out my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/fiznool) and visit my [LinkedIn page](https://uk.linkedin.com/in/fiznool).

If you are interesting in hiring me to work on a web or mobile application, or would like to learn more about the training courses I run, why not [get in touch](mailto:hello@tomspencer.dev)?
